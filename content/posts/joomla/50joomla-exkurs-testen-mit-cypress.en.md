Automated tests are not a special tool for software developers in large projects. Especially for smaller extensions, automated tests are a help to quickly identify problems. They help to ensure that extensions work smoothly in newer Joomla versions. The Joomla Core developers want third-party software developers to test their extensions. This way, bugs are noticed before a user finds them. This requires a lot of work and is therefore often not done. Especially not if it has to be done manually by humans for each release. Automatic testing makes it possible to repeat the manual steps for each release without a human performing the steps themselves. This way, bugs are found before a user encounters them when accessing the live system.<!-- \index{tests} --><!-- \index{Cypress} -->
