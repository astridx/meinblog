You have created a plug-in in the previous section. You have probably already configured other plugins in the plugin manager and know the different types. Plugins cover many different areas in Joomla. This chapter provides an overview of what plugins are and how they work within Joomla.

## What is a Joomla plugin?

You already know that there are different types of extensions: Components, modules, templates, languages and plugins. While components, modules, templates and languages usually cause a direct output, a plugin typically works in the background. Plugins are versatile. Each plugin has its own purpose. 
Let's organise plugins a little. Even within Joomla, they are divided into plugin groups. It's much easier to understand the purpose if you look at each type separately. For example, content plugins and system plugins. Fortunately, it is not difficult to write a sample plugin. You already saw that in the last chapter. In this chapter, we will get an overview of the different types and their special features.
