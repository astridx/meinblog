When a decision has to be made, it is done economically when a single person decides who has all the information. It is most efficient if he creates an algorithm for this purpose. Ethically, the result is acceptable if the individual has the common good in mind.
 
The worst way to bring about a decision is also via an individual, or with the help of an algorithm created by him. In this case, the human being is someone who acts selfishly and/or does not have enough information.

In between, other forms can be distinguished, depending on how many decision-makers are involved, whether the people judge directly or create an algorithm for this purpose, and whether they act in the interest of the common good and have sufficient information or not.
