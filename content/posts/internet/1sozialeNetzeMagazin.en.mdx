# Making the Joomla website an ActivityPub server and being an independent participant in Fediverse - a start

## Fediverse, ActivityPub, IndieWeb - and Joomla

I don't know exactly when I first heard about Fediverse. I mean it was this post(https://blog.novatrend.ch/2021/06/21/mastodon-pixelfed-unter-ios-die-charmante-alternative-zu-twitter-instagram/) from my bookmarks. I found it exciting. But I did not get stuck. When at the beginning of the year 2022 the big excitement about Elon Musk and Twitter began, I was surprised that in the Joomla community many had never heard the terms Fediverse, ActivityPub or IndieWeb. After all, these are mostly people with an affinity for technology. I admit that I had heard all the terms before, but I can't really define them. I wanted to change that and maybe it interests the one or other Joomlaner likewise. Also, I feel quite comfortable in Fediverse by now and would like to advertise this a bit.


### The Fediverse

**Fediverse** refers to a network of federated, mutually independent social networks, microblogging services, and web pages for online publication or data hosting. The concept began in 2008 with [GNU Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social) and continued in 2016 with [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) and the Communication Protocol defined in 2018 by the World Wide Web (W3C) *[ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub)*.


> The fediverse (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is an ensemble of federated (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for web publishing (i.e. social networking, microblogging, blogging, or websites) and file hosting, but which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other. On different servers (instances), users can create so-called identities. These identities are able to communicate over the boundaries of the instances because the software running on the servers supports one or more communication protocols which follow an open standard. As an identity on the fediverse, users are able to post text and other media, or to follow posts by other identities. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse)



All right, that's a lot of theory. Let's break down the definition.

> interconnected servers [...] that are hosted independently [...] can communicate with each other.

So basically people run their own servers, but they can communicate with each other because they have agreed on rules or a standard.

> [...] create so-called identities

so, create an account

> These identities can communicate [...]

but this account is recognized by other servers.

This means the Fediverse is not centrally organized like Twitter. It is more like email servers. You can create a `@community.joomla.org`, a `@gmail.com` or your own account like `@astrid-guenther.de`. 

This has advantages:

1. you can host your own server and thus control your data.
2. you can be part of a community that has as strict or loose rules as you want.

There are many Fediverse services. The most popular is [mastodon] (https://joinmastodon.org/). Mastodon is similar to Twitter in its application, while offering different instances. So you can have an account at [https://fimidi.com](https://fimidi.com) or [https://mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) or something else entirely. No matter what you use, you can communicate with it.




There is not only Mastodon. In general, federation can be used for something like a YouTube clone like [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/), audio streaming like [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/), Instagram clone like [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.org/), event planning like [Gath.io](https://gath.io/), and many other things. Among many other things could be a CMSs. [Wordpress](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/activitypub) for example. More on that later. The key point is that an identity can be used for each of these systems, and the server you use can choose who to partner with. If you host the server yourself, you decide. Specifically, this means the following:

- The server in the Fediverse is censorship resistant.

- The Fediverse allows you to join a community that doesn't allow things you don't like

- Services in the Fediverse let you control your data as much as you want.

That sounds contrary. How can something be censorship resistant, but still have communities with rules? Well, the key word here is communities, and they are plural. These communities are still separate, they just join together *if* they want to.

If an instance is home to people discussing things you and your community don't care about, you won't join. You can post the most awesome Joomla news on your server. A garden community will share little content with you. There are certainly malicious participants in Fediverse, just like in real life. It is possible for for the "bad" people to exchange on one instance without censorship. This is a problem point for many, but it is much better than the central alternative.

### ActivityPub

> ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol based on the [ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) data format. ActivityPub is an official W3C recommended standard published by the [W3C Social Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg). It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and subscribing to content. - [activitypub.rocks](https://activitypub.rocks/)

Sounds exciting? No! But it is useful!

It is a way for services and websites to communicate with each other. It's a part of the federation mentioned above. Basically, it's a pledge about how things federate, the protocol or the rules.

This is more understandable with an example from everyday life. When people talk to each other, you use language. The conversation is the federation. The grammar rules and vocabulary is ActivityPub.

### The IndieWeb 

> The IndieWeb is a [people](https://indieweb.org/people)-focused alternative to the "corporate web". - [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/)

Honestly, that says everything and nothing. The description also fits the Fediverse, so what's the difference? Let's take a closer look below.

#### You are better connected

Your articles and status updates can go [to all services](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), not just one, so you can connect with everyone. Even replies and likes on other services can [be redirected back to your website](https://indieweb.org/backfeed), so they're all in one place.


That's a rewrite for when you post something on your own website, it should automatically post links to all those linked websites. Your website should also automatically pull responses from all of those things.

In addition, in terms of the indie web, it's important to be independent. This means that large corporate websites, in terms of decentralization are not desired.

### FAQ

1. Why would i want my website in Fediverse or IndieWeb?

You want your website to be able to interact with other websites.

2. Why would I want my website to be able to do that?

You want your content to connect with content on other websites without publishing directly to any of those places. This means that you still have full control over that site, plus you can share it with others, regardless of platform.

3. Are ActivityPub and Federation the same thing?

ActivityPub and Federation are becoming more and more synonymous. However, they are actually not the same thing. Federation stands for union or connection. ActivityPub regulates this federation. ActivityPub has the disadvantage that you have to follow rules. ActivityPub has the advantage that you can rely on rules.

4. I'm still confused.

If a big social network like Twitter, Facebook or Instagramm gets shut down, you lose your followers and your content. For some platforms, it's not a matter of "if" but "when." Such events are usually followed by a flight to a variety of different platforms, where you inevitably lose some people because you have to decide which one to stay on. It's happened before. But it doesn't have to happen again. Use the federated web. Ideally, you'll use the federated web, where you can rely on rules.
