A network is made of nodes and connections.

![How is the internet networked?](/images/1a.en.png)

## Nodes and connections

A network node sends or gets information. To do this, it needs an address. On the Internet[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet], this address is called an IP address and is based on the Internet protocol family[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite], which uses the Internet protocol[^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol]. 

## Special nodes

Some nodes do special tasks. 

### Router 

Within a network, the nodes know each other. An interface is necessary for communication with the outside. This task is performed by a router [^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)]. 

### Client and server

Servers [^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)] provide a service that is used by the client [^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)]. A service is an application. The internet provides the platform for the use of the application.

- You connect your email client to an email server. 
- A web browser is a client that uses the services of a web server to display a website. 
- Social networks such as Twitter or Mastodon, 
- e-commerce websites like Amazon or the little web shop of the Fair Trade Shop in your town, 
- mobile apps like the weather app

are examples where a client and a server are involved. 

In distributed peer-to-peer networks [^en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer], this distribution of roles is cancelled. Each device has equal status and has the possibility to act as a server and as a client at the same time. 

## Types of networks

## central

In a central network, one router takes over the routing. In a graphical illustration, this has the shape of a star. 

## decentralised

A network is decentralised if it communicates with the help of many routers. A graphical visualisation shows many connected stars.

### distributed

Computer-to-computer connections represent a distributed network when there is communication between equals. In pure peer-to-peer networks, all computers have equal rights. They take services and provide their own in return. In a graph, no hierarchy can be seen. All nodes are meshed with each other.

> In a distributed network, everyone has equal status. In reality, we are seeing an increased centralisation of services on the internet.
