Gatsby is an open-source framework based on React that helps build websites and apps. It allows you to build your website and apps using React and then generates HTML, CSS, and JS when you build for production.

One of the many advantages of using Gatsby is that it allows accessing data through a query language called GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. Gatsby uses GraphQL because it provides the following:

* Specificity: Request only the data needed and not whatever is returned by the API.
* Static Build: Perform data transformations at build time within GraphQL queries.
* Standardized: It's a performant data querying language for the often complex/nested data dependencies.

If you are interested, you can read more about [why Gatsby uses GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/why-gatsby-uses-graphql/). In this article, I'll share some useful tips for when using GraphQL in a Gatsby project.

# Create Gatsby Pages from GraphQL Query

By default, pages/routes in Gatsby are created by creating a new file in the `src/pages` folder i.e creating an `about.js` file means creating a page at `/about`. However there's another method to creating pages, and that's using the [createPage](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/actions/#createPage) action in conjunction with the [createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#createPages) API to programmatically create pages. This method also provides you with more options when creating these pages such as customizing the page's slug.

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
const path = require('path')

exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions
  const ShopPage = path.resolve(`src/components/shop-page.js`)

  createPage({
    path: "/store",
    component: ShopPage,
    context: {},
  })
}
```

In the code snippet above, the createPage action is used to create a page at `/store`. The [createPage](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/actions/#createPage) action accepts multiple arguments but I'll focus on the following arguments:

* `path` - This is the relative URL of the page and should always start with a slash.
* `component` - This is the path to the React component which is used as template for this page.
* `context` - This is an object that can contain any data to be passed down to the React component as [props](/react-pass-props-to-component).

Essentially createPage helps us everywhere where we need to create pages dynamically. A more practical use for the createPage action would be creating multiple pages for each article in a publication website. It's the best method for this use case because it allows creating multiple pages programmatically from an external source. It's also a good option because we could use the data gotten from the external source to create permalinks/paths for the pages. Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
const path = require('path')

exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions
  const ArticlePage = path.resolve(`src/components/article-page.js`)

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(
      graphql(
        `{
            articles: allArticles {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  slug
                  title
                  category {
                    slug
                  }
                }
              }
            }
        }`,
      ).then(result => {
        result.data.articles.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createPage({
            path: `${edge.node.category.slug}/${edge.node.slug}`,
            component: ArticlePage,
            context: {
              slug: edge.node.slug
            },
          })
        })
      }),
    )
}
```

In the code above, we're querying a (fictional) external GraphQL source to fetch article entries. The query body contains the properties that we'd want to be returned in the result which would be useful in constructing the permalink.

The result gotten back from the query is then used to create the pages by looping through the result and using the article's property to create a path for the page.

Another useful tip for when creating pages programmatically is extracting the createPage actions just in case they are a lot for the `gatsby-node.js` file. It helps to declutter the file and make the code more readable.

This usually happens when there are multiple queries and multiple pages to be created. See the code snippet below as an example:

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js
const path = require('path')

exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions
  const ArticlePage = path.resolve(`src/components/article-page.js`)
  const AuthorPage = path.resolve(`src/components/author-page.js`)
  const ProductPage = path.resolve(`src/components/product-page.js`)

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(
      graphql(
        `{
            articles: allArticles {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  slug
                  title
                  category {
                    slug
                  }
                }
              }
            }
            authors: allAuthors {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  slug
                  name
                  bio
                }
              }
            }
            products: allProducts {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  slug
                  title
                }
              }
            }
        }`,
      ).then(result => {
        result.data.articles.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createPage({
            path: `${edge.node.category.slug}/${edge.node.slug}`,
            component: ArticlePage,
            context: {
              slug: edge.node.slug
            },
          })
        })

        result.data.authors.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createPage({
            path: `${edge.node.slug}`,
            component: AuthorPage,
            context: {
              slug: edge.node.slug
            },
          })
        })

        result.data.products.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createPage({
            path: `${edge.node.slug}`,
            component: ProductPage,
            context: {
              slug: edge.node.slug
            },
          })
        })
      }),
    )
}
```

The code snippet above is similar to the first one we created, with the addition of more queries to fetch more data. If we continue adding queries and `createPage` actions at this rate, the `gatsby-node.js` would become cluttered and a very long file to scroll through.

A possible fix would be to extract the `createPage` actions to individual files for each of the pages that you'd like to create in the Gatsby project. This means creating page-specific helpers to manage each page, rather than putting all pages in the same place. The end result should be that the file is pretty declarative for each Gatsby hook that it implements:

```javascript
// createArticlePages.js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = (createPage, edge) => {
  const ArticlePage = path.resolve(`src/components/article-page.js`)

  createPage({
    path: `${edge.node.category.slug}/${edge.node.slug}`,
    component: ArticlePage,
    context: {
      slug: edge.node.slug
    },
  })
}
```

```javascript
// createAuthorPages.js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = (createPage, edge) => {
  const AuthorPage = path.resolve(`src/components/author-page.js`)

  createPage({
    path: `${edge.node.category.slug}/${edge.node.slug}`,
    component: AuthorPage,
    context: {
      slug: edge.node.slug
    },
  })
}
```

```javascript
// createProductPages.js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = (createPage, edge) => {
  const ProductPage = path.resolve(`src/components/product-page.js`)

  createPage({
    path: `${edge.node.category.slug}/${edge.node.slug}`,
    component: ProductPage,
    context: {
      slug: edge.node.slug
    },
  })
}
```

The three code snippets above are page-specific helper functions; `createArticlePages`, `createAuthorPages`, and `createProductPages` which will help to create the article pages, author pages, and product pages respectively. They also accept an argument of the `createPage` action itself and an `edge` object that contains the data needed for creating the path.

The new helper functions can then be used in the `gatsby-node.js` file like this.

```javascript
// gatsby-node.js

import createArticlePages from './createArticlePages'
import createAuthorPages from './createAuthorPages'
import createProductPages from './createProductPages'

exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve(
      graphql(
        `{
            articles: allArticles {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  slug
                  title
                  category {
                    slug
                  }
                }
              }
            }
            authors: allAuthors {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  slug
                  name
                  bio
                }
              }
            }
            products: allProducts {
              edges {
                node {
                  id
                  slug
                  title
                }
              }
            }
        }`,
      ).then(result => {
        result.data.articles.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createArticlePages(createPage, edge)
        })

        result.data.authors.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createAuthorPages(createPage, edge)
        })

        result.data.products.edges.forEach(edge => {
          createProductPages(createPage, edge)
        })
      }),
    )
}
```

This implementation helps to make sure that the `gatsby-node.js` file remains decluttered and easy to read.

# Page query vs StaticQuery

Gatsby provides you with two methods for fetching data using GraphQL - Page Query and StaticQuery. [Page query](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/page-query/) is a method that allows you to use the `graphql` tag in your React components to fetch data. The [StaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query/) is a method in which you can the [useStaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/use-static-query/) React Hook to perform queries in your React component:

```jsx
// example of a page query
// article-page.js
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import React from 'react'

const ArticlePage = ({ data }) => {
  return (
  	{data.edges.map(article, index) => (
      <h2>{article.title}</h2>
      <p>{article.snippet}</p>
  	)}
  )
}

export default ArticlePage

export const query = graphql`
  query Articles($locale: String!) {
    articles: allArticles(
      filter: { locale: { eq: $locale } }
    ) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          snippet
          locale
          publishDate
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

```

```jsx
// example of a static query
// article-page.js
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
import React from 'react'

const ArticlePage = ({ data }) => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query Articles {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          snippet
          locale
          publishDate
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  return (
  	{data.edges.map(article, index) => (
      <h2>{article.title}</h2>
      <p>{article.snippet}</p>
  	)}
  )
}

export default ArticlePage
```

The main difference between both methods is that page queries have access to the page context, which is defined during the `createPage` and this essentially means that page queries can accept GraphQL variables. Static queries do not have this feature.

Another difference between them is that static queries can be used anywhere in any component but page queries can only be used on pages which are used as `component` property in the createPage function.

# Using GraphQL fragments in Gatsby

When using GraphQL in Gatsby, it's most likely you'll be in a scenario where you've used a particular query a couple of times across multiple components. Luckily there's a feature in GraphQL called [fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) that allow you to create a set of fields and then include them in queries where they'd be used.

Fragments also help to convert complex queries into much smaller and modular queries. In a way it's similar to exporting a function from a helper file and then reusing that function in multiple components:

```javascript
// AuthorInfo.fragment.js
export const query = graphql`
  fragment AuthorInfo on AuthorEntry {
    id
    name
    slug
    twitter
    locale
  }
`
```

The code snippet above is an example of a fragment file in a Gatsby project. The query above fetches details about an author and we're assuming that this query has been written a couple of times throughout the codebase.

Fragments can be created in any GraphQL query but I find it better to create the query separately in a new file. There are 3 key elements in a fragment; the fragment's name, the [GraphQL type](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/object-types/) it will be used on and the actual body of the query.

Using the example above, `AuthorInfo` is the name of the fragment and what will be used to reference it in other components. `AuthorEntry` is the GraphQL type and the body is the object values.

Once you have this file created, all you need to do is use the fragment anywhere in the Gatsby project:

```javascript
// ArticlePage.js
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import React from 'react'

const ArticlePage = ({data}) => {
  // Use the `data` property here...
}

export const query = graphql`
  query FetchArticle {
    article {
      id
      slug
      title
      publishDate
      author {
        ...AuthorInfo
      }
    }
	}
`
```

There's no need to import the file or fragment before using it because Gatsby already knows to preprocess all GraphQL queries whilst compiling the site.

### GraphQL Fragments in Gatsby with TypeScript

If you use TypeScript in your Gatsby project, you can also define types when creating your GraphQL fragment. This means that wherever you would use your fragment, you can use its type to ensure that you're getting what's expected. Using the code snippet below as an example:

```javascript
// AuthorInfo.fragment.ts
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'

export interface AuthorInfoFragment {
  id: string
  name: string
  slug: string
  twitter: string
  locale: string
}

export const query = graphql`
  fragment AuthorInfo on AuthorEntry {
    id
    name
    slug
    twitter
    locale
  }
`
```

In the code snippet above, there's a GraphQL fragment called `AuthorInfo` and an interface called `AuthorInfoFragment`, both of which are exported. These two can then be used in another component to query GraphQL and check for type safety respectively. Using the code snippet below as an example, we are trying to fetch an article entry using the GraphQL query at the bottom.

```javascript
// ArticlePage.tsx
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import React from 'react'

// Import the TypeScript interface from the fragment file
import { AuthorInfoFragment } from 'AuthorInfo.fragment.ts'

interface Props {
  data: {
    article: {
      id: string
      slug: string
      title: string
      publishDate: string
      author: AuthorInfoFragment
    }
  }
}

const ArticlePage = ({data}) => {
  // Use the `data` property here...
}

export const query = graphql`
  query FetchArticle {
    article {
      id
      slug
      title
      publishDate
      author {
        ...AuthorInfo
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Included in the query is the `author` property which uses the `AuthorInfo` fragment, and we're also type-checking the content of `author` in the `Prop` TypeScript interface.

# GraphQL Playground for Gatsby

Whenever you run your Gatsby site in development mode, it also launches [GraphiQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/running-queries-with-graphiql/), an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema at `localhost:8000/___graphql`:

![Prisma GraphQL](./images/prisma.png)

However, there's an alternative to GraphiQL, and that's the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground) by Prisma. It allows you to interact with all the data, schemas added by additional Gatsby plugins. GraphQL Playground uses components of GraphiQL under the hood but is essentially a more powerful GraphQL IDE that enables better development workflows. The GraphQL Playground also adds additional features like:

* Interactive, multi-column schema documentation.
* Multiple Tabs just like you'd have in an IDE.
* Customizable HTTP headers.
* Query history.

To use the GraphQL Playground in your Gatsby project, edit the `develop` script in the `package.json` file:

```json
// package.json
"develop": "GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground gatsby develop",
```

If you're on Windows then the script should look like this and also install the `cross-env` package:

```json
// package.json
"develop": "cross-env GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground gatsby develop"
```

Once you've modified the script, you can then run `yarn develop` to run the site in development mode and also launch the new GraphQL Playground.
